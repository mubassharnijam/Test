                    I just wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude for the Service From The Heart initiative. This programme has truly made a difference in my time here at Dialog and I am proud to be a part of it.
                    
                    One of my most memorable moments was in 2017 when I received my first SFH Certificate directly from DR. Hans for a new product initiative. It was an incredible encouragement for me as an executive and it truly impacted my thoughts and approach towards work at Dialog.
                    
                    Since then, I have been continuously participating in SFH initiatives and I am proud to say that it has helped me stay energetic and motivated in my role. I truly believe that the culture transformation brought about by SFH has made Dialog an amazing place for both employees and customers.
                    
                    Thank you for this program and for all the hard work you put into making it a success. Here's to many more years of Service From The Heart!

Because of this, culture is the first of our four cornerstones and is vital to a successful business. “Service From the Heart” was a phrase that resonated with us.  We take Customer Service to H.E.A.R.T. through Helpfulness, Expertise, Attentiveness, Respect, and Timeliness. Delivering from the heart also means personalizing service each and every time. Our company vision “Service from The Heart” rightly places customers at the Centre of our business and everything we do. Api Dialog team plays a vital role within the business to ensure this vision is upheld. Customer service comes from one place – the heart of a servant. It involves the passion to serve others above and beyond their expectations. It creates “Wow” moments, when customers cannot believe the excellence in service they are receiving. If our customers are happy with the product and support, they receive, then they are more likely to return to our sites, as well as spread their positive experience with family and friends which is so important to us because it means that we are aligned to our Company vision. Like any family we laugh, we smile, we cry, we celebrate success, WE MAKE A DIFFERENCE, and most importantly we do it all together! When talented people come together in an environment where they feel supported, they can achieve remarkable things. By keeping “Service from The Heart” culture firmly at the heart of strategic execution, we believe that Dialog will achieve more than we ever imagined.

I feel that every member of the Apidialog family is part of this program, and we share a common mission of serving and helping our customers.

                    The SFH Fun Bucket allocation has been an amazing gesture of goodwill towards our customers and has enabled us to serve customers even when it seemed impossible to do so. It has been an invaluable tool to show our customers that we care and want to help them in any way we can.
